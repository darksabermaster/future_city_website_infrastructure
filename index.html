The city uses light materials such as sea brick and steel that can be 3D printed in the future. We will print 3D parts to produce structures for quick and precise construction. The city tiles are connected with a pin-and-hole system. We will deposit rubber between the edges to ensure slow movements in the city tiles do not rattle against each other but softly get pushed away. We will also routinely replace the rubber and poles to ensure safety from disaster. The rubber also is shaped to make a seal to prevent water from going up between the tiles. It is anchored because we don't want it drifting into rocks. We would use more than one anchor for safety and durability. We would make the buildings earthquake-resistant because the city is on the ocean. We need a ballast system to maintain the same level between plates. Saltwater will be easier to collect in the future. Our waist dispersal facilities will re-salinate and clean before releasing the cord.
